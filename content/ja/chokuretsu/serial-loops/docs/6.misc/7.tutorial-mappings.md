## Overview
Tutorials exist only in the puzzle phase and appear when various things occur the first time the player plays through the puzzle phase
to explain how various things in the game work. Each tutorial has an associated flag and script.

## In Serial Loops
The script associated with each tutorial flag can be remapped by opening the tutorial mappings dialog from "Tools" &rarr; "Edit Tutorial Mappings...".
Simply use the dropdown box to change the script mapped to the tutorial to your heart's content.
