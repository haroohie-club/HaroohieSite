Voice lines are the spoken lines both for dialogue sections and for various other bits such as the puzzle phase, the group selection screen, and the title screen.

## Replacing
Voice lines can be replaced exactly like [background music](./bgm).

## Subtitles
If using the Haroohie Translation Club's English patch v0.8 or higher (or another language patch with subtitles), voice lines can be given subtitles. Simply type the subtitle
into the provided text box and you will see a preview of the subtitle on the right side of the screen. Note that subtitles are limited to one line in length.

Additionally, you can select the subtitle's text color from the set of defined [dialogue text colors](../misc/dialogue-colors), the screen to display the subtitle on and where to position it on that screen, and 
choose to force drop shadow or not on top screen subs or not.
