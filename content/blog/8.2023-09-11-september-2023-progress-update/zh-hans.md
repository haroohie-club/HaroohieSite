Hello all! We hope you're having a great September. Today, we'd like to share a brief progress update with everyone!

## The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya
We're pleased to announce that we've reached the incredible milestone of completing all the base translation work for *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuertsu* (DS) &mdash; that's all episodes 1-5, plus the extras mode and menus!

Of course, translating is just the first step in our quality assurance process!
We still have a lot of files left to proofread (where editors read through,
correct typos and unnatural-sounding dialogue), translation check (where a
second translator has a read through and adjusts the script if needed), and
review (which is done by project lead, [Jonko](/author/jonko)). Not to mention
creating the remaining graphics and thorough playtesting! We've also been going
through and updating some of the earlier files to bring their translation
quality in-line with our current standards.

We're excited to bring you the English translation of *Chapter 3: A Midsummer Graduation* very soon! Stay tuned here and on our socials for the update post!

*(P.S. &mdash; have you checked out the editing suite we've built for Chokuretsu, [Serial Loops](/chokuretsu/serial-loops/), yet?!)*

## The Parallel of Haruhi Suzumiya
Behind the scenes, we've also been working on *Suzumiya Haruhi no Heiretsu* (Wii). Preliminary work was already in place for replacing the font and graphics, but this month we've began the process of translating the game using our workflow.

I'm sure she needs no introduction, but the girl in front of me, rambling on and on and glaring at me despite the midsummer heat, is Haruhi Suzumiya."](/images/blog/0008/02_heiretsu_early_haruhi.png)

One point we've been working on is reverse-engineering the 3D engine and event system to allow us to gather a deeper understanding of how these are structured. This will also enable us to replace certain important graphics, such as the animated 3D game logo.

When we have more to share, we'll also open up the Heiretsu section of this website with more details. Stay tuned!
