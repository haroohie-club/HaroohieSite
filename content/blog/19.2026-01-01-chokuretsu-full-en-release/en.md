## Finally!

With the release of Episode 5, the English patch of The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya (Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu) is now complete!

Bugs have been fixed (including the Mikuru crash mentioned in the last release), as well as various translation inconsistencies from previous errors.

A huge thank you to Hans Harmony for once again putting together our release trailer!

## Download the release
Please check [the guide](/chokuretsu/guide) for how to apply the patch to your Nintendo DS ROM file.

* [Online ROM patcher](/chokuretsu/patch)
* [Download patch file](https://github.com/haroohie-club/ChokuretsuTranslationRelease/releases/latest)

There's also one other quick thing we'd like to show off...

## Chokuretsu Wrapped

If you're interested in seeing how your game of Chokuretsu stacks up against other players, we now have a cool little site called [Chokuretsu Wrapped](https://haroohie.club/chokuretsu/wrapped).

Simply upload a completed Chokuretsu save and you'll be able to see your choices, stats, and more and compare how they stack up against those of other players.

## Happy New Year!

This patch has been four years in the making. Thank you all so much for your patience and kind words on this journey. For me personally, this project utterly transformed my life, and from what others on the team have said, I'm not alone in that. Congrats to everyone on the team for the release and here's to the releases to come!
