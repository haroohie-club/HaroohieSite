Hi folks! This is my first YouTube video that isn't just a recording of a panel. It's in the vein of my blog posts I've been making for... two years now? Oh wow, that's a long time.

A guy joined our Discord a while back and asked for help hacking the game *Dragon Ball Kai: Ultimate Butouden* and I decided to stream myself hacking the game from scratch. This video is the result of that!

As is noted in the description of the video, our friend from the Discord is a Lebanese man who was forced to flee his home due to Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Please consider [supporting BDS](https://bdsmovement.net/get-involved/what-to-boycott)
and doing what you can to pressure your government to condemn Israel and try to bring an end to their monstrous cruelty.
