I'm hard at work on the next Chokuretsu ROM Hacking blog post. I love weird dates and I really wanted to post it on this year's leap day,
but it doesn't look like it's going to be ready in time. So instead, I'm making this announcement post so that I at least have a post on
the 29th. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

Please look forward to the real post!
