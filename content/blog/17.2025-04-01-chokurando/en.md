While randomizers are all the rage, few people are as bold as I am when I imagined a future in which even something as story-driven as a visual novel could be randomized. Those few people, however, do include the Kyoto Animation staff that decided to air the first season of _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_ anachronologically.

In the spirit of that grand tradition, I present to you "ChokuRando": a randomizer for _Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu_ (The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya)!

(Happy April Fools' Day! But the randomizer is actually real. I don't recommend using it since we haven't released the full patch yet&mdash;and even when we do, I doubt it will be much fun to play lol&mdash;but you can try it out [here]!)
