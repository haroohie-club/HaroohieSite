Hi folks! For the past year, I have been presenting a panel at several different conventions on ROM hacking Chokuretsu.
At Retro World Expo in Hartford, Connecticut, [Andy Wolan](https://www.youtube.com/@andywolan) (formerly of the Sonic Stuff Research Group)
made a recording of the panel that I've now posted to my YouTube channel. If you're interested in hearing a bit about how we hacked
this game, you'll likely enjoy giving it a watch!

### Update
Thanks to [Xzonn](xzonn.top), who is working with a team to translate Chokuretsu into Chinese, this talk has now been translated into Chinese
and is available with Chinese subtitles on both YouTube and [bilbili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w4421P7Wd/)!
