The script items control what happens in individual scenes, but the _scenario_ is what controls when specific script files are loaded.
To edit the overall game's flow, Serial Loops provides editors for the _Scenario_ item and for the various _Group Selection_ items.

Additionally, we put the game's _Maps_ and _Puzzles_ in this section as well since they are major game activities that take place outside
of the scripts.
