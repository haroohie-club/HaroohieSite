The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view puzzle data, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing maps and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
The puzzle editor lets you view the contents of puzzles, including their associated main [topics](/chokuretsu/serial-loops/docs/misc/topics), an ASCII representation of the configured route Haruhi will take through the course of the puzzle, and configuration settings for the map; including singularity counts, quotas, the graphic used to represent singularities, and the time limit.
