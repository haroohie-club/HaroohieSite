The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view group selections, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing group selections and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
Group selection items represent the sections of the game where you divide up the SOS Brigade to accomplish different tasks. The effect that
they have is twofold:

1. The task you send Kyon to and the Brigade members you send with him determine the scene that plays out after group selection
2. The group distributions determine which topics are obtained in the tasks you don't send Kyon to

The former of these is well-understood; the latter is less so.

Group selections are specified in the [Scenario](./2.scenario.md) file.
