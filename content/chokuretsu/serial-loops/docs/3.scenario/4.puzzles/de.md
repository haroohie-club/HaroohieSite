The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view puzzle items, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing items and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
Puzzles are used in the aptly-named puzzle phase of the game, where Kyon walks around on a map finding and erasing singularities.

## In Serial Loops
The puzzle editor lets you view the contents of puzzles, including their associated main [topics](../misc/topics), an ASCII representation of the
possible Haruhi Routes for the puzzle, the map the puzzle is played on, and configuration settings for the puzzle including singularity counts,
quotas, the graphic used to represent singularities, and the time limit.
