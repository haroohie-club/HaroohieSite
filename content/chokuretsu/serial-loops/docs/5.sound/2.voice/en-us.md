Voice lines are the spoken lines both for dialogue sections and for various other bits such as the puzzle phase, the group selection screen, and the title screen.

## Replacing
Voice lines can be replaced exactly like [background music](./bgm).

## Subtitles
If using the Haroohie Translation Club's English patch v0.6 or higher, voice lines can be given subtitles.
