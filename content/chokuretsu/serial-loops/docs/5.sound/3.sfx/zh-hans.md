Sound effects cover everything from the beeps of menu interactions to the lengthy cicada chirps of the opening crawl. Additionally, the characters'
voice fonts are also sound effects.

## In Serial Loops
Sound effects can currently be played back in Serial Loops, allowing you to preview an effect before adding it to a script. Additionally, the editor
allows you to view which bank the SFX belongs to (not incredibly useful at this time) and which groups it belongs to (which determines which scripts can use it).
