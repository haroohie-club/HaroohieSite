Backgrounds are used to display visual novel backgrounds as well as CGs. They can be viewed and edited through the background editor.

## Replacing
Backgrounds can easily be replaced in the background editor. Simply press the "Replace" button and select a new image file from disk. Images will be
automatically resized to match the size of the currently selected background. Background sizes are as follows:

| Background Type | Size (WxH in pixels) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| `KINETIC_SCREEN` | 256x194 | 16 color images, so make sure your image is exceedingly simple |
| `TEX_BG` | 256x194 | |
| `TEX_CG` | 256x194 | |
| `TEX_CG_DUAL_SCREEN` | 256x512 | Displayed on both screens, but each portion is taller than the full screen (scrolled with `BG_SCROLL`) |
| `TEX_CG_WIDE` | 512x192 | Displayed on bottom screen, but wider than the full screen (scrolled with BG_SCROLL) |
| `TEX_CG_SINGLE` | 256x256 | Displayed on bottom screen, but taller than bottom screen (scrolled with `BG_SCROLL`) |
