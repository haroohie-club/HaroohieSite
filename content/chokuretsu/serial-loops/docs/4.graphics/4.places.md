title: 'Places'
---

The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view places, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing places and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
Places are the graphics which display the current location that a scene is taking place in. They are displayed on the top screen and
chosen with the [`SET_PLACE`](../scripts/commands#set_place) command.

## Serial Loops
In the current version of Serial Loops, place graphics can be opened and their contents viewed.
