Places represent the location graphics that appear in the top screen during scripts. Serial Loops supports editing these through a simple text editor to automatically produce valid place graphics.

## Overview
Places are the graphics which display the current location that a scene is taking place in. They are displayed on the top screen and
chosen with the [`SET_PLACE`](../scripts/commands#set_place) command.

## Editing Places
To edit a place graphic, replace the text in the box with your own, and Serial Loops will automatically generate a valid place graphic. Note if the provided text exceeds the maximum width of the graphic, a horizontal ellipses (...) will be inserted; so avoid extremely long place names. When editing place graphics from their default values, the background will turn green (which is rendered transparently in-game).
