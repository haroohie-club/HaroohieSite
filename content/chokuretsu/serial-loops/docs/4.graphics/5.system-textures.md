## Overview
System Textures represent the textures used for *Chokuretsu*'s user interface (such as buttons and menus) as well as other miscellaneous system graphics (such as text flashes and the Haruhi Meter).

## In Serial Loops
Similarly to [backgrounds](/chokuretsu/serial-loops/docs/graphics/backgrounds), System Textures can be exported to a `.png` format, and can be replaced by importing an image from a common format, then scaled to the neccessary size with help from the [Crop & Scale tool](/chokuretsu/serial-loops/docs/graphics/backgrounds#crop-and-scale).
