The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view character sprites, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing character sprites and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## In Serial Loops
In the current version of Serial Loops, character sprites can be opened so their animations can be viewed. Additionally, they can be exported either
as a series of frames (which will be the format for editing them in future versions) or as an animated GIF.
