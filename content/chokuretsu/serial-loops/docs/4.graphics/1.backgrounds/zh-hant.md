Backgrounds are used to display visual novel backgrounds as well as CGs
(**c**omputer **g**raphics; a common term for full screen art in visual novels
that isn't overlaid with sprites). They can be viewed and edited through the
background editor.

## Replacing
Backgrounds can easily be replaced in the background editor. Simply press the "Replace" button and select a new image file from disk. This will open the built-in crop & scale  tool to let you size your image to fit the standard set of background sizes (see below).

### Crop and Scale
You can use the built-in Crop and Scale tool on imported images to scale it and
select the area of the image you wish to replace the original graphic with.
