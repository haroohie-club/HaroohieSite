The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view topics, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing topics and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
Topics are items given to the player throughout Chokuretsu that represent things that can be used to distract Haruhi. They are granted
during the main visual novel portions by the [`TOPIC_GET`](../scripts/commands#topic_get) command and can be used during the puzzle phase
to trigger associate scenes.

All topics have an ID, a name/title, and a type. Topic types are either **Main**, **Haruhi**, **Character**, or **Sub**. Additionally,
topics all have an episode and group selection they are associated with. Main, Haruhi, and Character topics also have an associated script
file. Finally, all topics have information on how much time the player will gain after using said topic during the puzzle phase.
