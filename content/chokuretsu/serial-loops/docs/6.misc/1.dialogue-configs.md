The current version of Serial Loops only allows you to view dialogue configs, not edit them, so the documentation here will be sparse.
In a future update, Serial Loops will be capable of fully editing dialouge configs and this documentation will be updated to be more complete.

## Overview
Dialogue configs define the voice font and text speed for a particular character. The "voice font" is the small beeping sound that is made as text
is drawn to the screen when no voiced line is playing. The text speed is controlled by a timer, so the lower the value, the faster the text appears
on the screen. The value of the voice font is not understood at this time.
