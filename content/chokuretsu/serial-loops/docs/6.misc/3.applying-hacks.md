Serial Loops has a built-in manager for applying useful hacks to your project.

## Apply Hacks menu
The Apply Hacks menu can be accessed through the "Apply Hacks..." option in the Tools menu.

The menu presents a list of hacks (see below) and whether they have been applied to the project. Select the hacks you wish to apply, then press SAVE to apply the hack to the project.

### Available Hacks
* **Skip OP** &mdash; If enabled, this will prevent the opening movie from playing and instead skip directly to the title screen.

### Importing Custom Hacks
Serial Loops supports importing ASM Hacks serialized in the `.slhack` format. To do this through the Apply Hacks menu, choose "Import," and select the `.slhack` file you wish to use.
