Chess puzzles can be viewed and partially edited in this version of Serial Loops. A future version of the editor will make them fully modifiable as well as allow for changing the mappings
to the puzzles in the extras' chess mode.

## Overview
The _chess puzzles_ are a bonus minigame encountered in episode 5 of the story as well as the extras mode. There are 65 unique puzzles in the game but about 100 defined chessboards.
Some of these boards are used as tutorials, while others simply go unused. Each chess puzzle is defined by the pieces on the board and how they are positioned as well as the number of moves
and time limit. There is an additional value that is provided but whose function is currently unknown.

## In Serial Loops
Currently, chess pieces can be dragged around the board to edit their position, and the number of moves and time limit can be edited. However, pieces cannot currently be added/removed
and the mappings between the chess puzzle selection menu and the chess scripts cannot currently be changed.
