title: 'Commands'
---

The following document explains what every command in the game does.

## Notes
* Time in these commands is always defined in terms of _frames_. The game assumes a frame is 1/30 of a second, i.e. 30 frames per second. Thus, to wait one second,
one would `WAIT` for 30 frames.

## `AVOID_DISP`
**Parameters**: None

Displays the "Main Topic -> Avoid" graphics.


## `BACK`
**Parameters**: None

When used in the initial script section, starts execution to the first script block. Otherwise, makes the script return to whatever called it (e.g. the puzzle phase)
or returns you to the investigation phase.


## `BG_DISP`
**Parameters**:
* `Background`: The background to be displayed

Displays a [background](../graphics/backgrounds) image on the lower screen. The background image can only be of type `TEX_BG`.


## `BG_DISP2`
While this is listed as a separate command, it uses the same routine as [`BG_DISP`](#bg_disp).


## `BG_DISPCG`
**Parameters**:
* `Background`: The CG background to be displayed
* `Display from Bottom`: If true, displays the bottom of a tall background (`TEX_CG_SINGLE`); if false, displays the top

`BG_DISPCG` works as [`BG_DISP`](#bg_disp) but can display a larger variety of textures &ndash; namely, `TEX_CG`, `TEX_CG_DUAL_SCREEN`,
`TEX_CG_WIDE`, and `TEX_CG_SINGLE` BGs. Notably, these are all CGs as opposed to VN backgrounds. Before displaying a standard BG after calling BG_DISPC,
one should call [`BG_REVERT`](#bg_revert).


## `BG_FADE`
**Parameters**:
* `Background`: The background to display as with [`BG_DISP`](#bg_disp)
* `Background (Temp/CG)`: The index of a background to display as [`BG_DISPCG`](#bg_dispcg); specify instead of `Background`
* `Fade Time (Frames)`: The time to fade in in frames

Like the other BG display commands but crossfades the background rather than just displaying it.


## `BG_REVERT`
**Parameters**: None

Reverts the background to the last call of `BG_DISP` (i.e. undoes any [`BG_FADE`](#bg_fade) or [`BG_DISPCG`](#bg_dispcg) calls).
This is required before returning to displaying standard `TEX_BG` BGs. Note that if reverting a `TEX_CG_DUAL_SCREEN` BG, [`SET_PLACE`](#set_place)
must have been used to set the place location and have it displayed.

`BG_REVERT` does something odd to previously displayed CGs that makes attmpeting to display them again after the `BG_REVERT` crash/freeze/soft lock the game.
If you need to go back and forth between the same CGs, consider using [`BG_FADE`](#bg_fade).


## `BG_SCROLL`
**Parameters**:
* `Scroll Direction`: The direction to scroll the BG
* `Scroll Speed`: Speed at which to scroll (1 is a good default)

When a background that is larger than the screen is shown (such as `TEX_CG_DUAL_SCREEN`, `TEX_CG_WIDE`, and `TEX_CG_SINGLE`),
scrolls the background in a DEFINED direction.


## `BGM_PLAY`
**Parameters**:
* `Music`: The background music to start or stop playing
* `Mode`: Whether to start or stop the music
* `Volume`: The volume of the BGM (0 is silent, 100 is max)
* `Fade In Time (Frames)`: Time in frames that the BGM will fade in
* `Fade Out Time (Frames)`: Time in frames that the BGM will fade out

Plays or stops background music.


## `CHESS_CLEAR_ANNOTATIONS`
**Parameters**: None

Clears all chessboard annotations. Unused.


## `CHESS_LOAD`
**Parameters**:
* `Chess File`: The chess file to load

## `CHESS_MOVE`
**Parameters**:
* `White Space Begin`: The space where a white piece to move is
* `White Space End`: The space where the white piece should move to
* `Black Space Begin`: The space where a black piece to move is
* `Black Space End`: The space where the black piece should move to

Moves a piece (or pieces) on the chessboard.


## `CHESS_RESET`
**Parameters**: None

Resets the chessboard to its original state.


## `CHESS_TOGGLE_CROSS`
**Parameters**:
* `Cross Space 0-15`: The spaces to place/remove a cross on

Crosses out spaces on the chessboard with a red X. If a space is already crossed out, this command uncrosses it out.


## `CHESS_TOGGLE_GUIDE`
**Parameters**:
* `Piece 1`: A space containing a piece whose potential moves to highlight
* `Piece 2`: A space containing a piece whose potential moves to highlight
* `Piece 3`: A space containing a piece whose potential moves to highlight
* `Piece 4`: A space containing a piece whose potential moves to highlight

Highlights the potential moves of a piece in red. If a piece has already been highlighted, this command unhighlights it.


## `CHESS_VGOTO`
**Parameters**:
* `Clear Block`: Script block to go to if the chess game is cleared
* `Miss Block`: Script block to go to if the chess game is failed
* `Miss 2 Block`: Script block to go to if the chess game is failed in some unused way

Monitors for the end of the chess game and then jumps to a specified script block depending on the outcome.


## `CHESS_TOGGLE_HIGHLIGHT`
**Parameters**:
* `Highligh Space 0-15`: The spaces to highlight

Highlights spaces on the chessboard in yellow. If a space is already highlighted, this command unhighlights it.


## `CHIBI_EMOTE`
**Parameters**:
* `Chibi`: The chibi to emote

This command displays an emote in a speech bubble above a [chibi](../graphics/chibis) figure on the top screen.


## `CHIBI_ENTEREXIT`
**Parameters**:

* `Enter/Exit`: Specifies whether the chibi is entering or exiting
* `Delay (Frames)`: Specifies the number of frames after which the chibi should enter or exit

Specifies a [chibi](../graphics/chibis) figure to enter or exit the top screen. To be used by this command, a chibi must have
a walk cycle (animation 01) in addition to its default idle animation (animation 00).


## `CONFETTI`
**Parameters**:
* `Visible`: If true turns confetti on. If false, turns it off.

Displays falling confetti on the top screen.


## `DIALOGUE`
**Parameters**:
* `Dialogue`: The dialogue line, composed of a speaker and the dialogue text

* `No Lip Flap`: Manually disables lip flaps for dialogue that would otherwise have them

Displays a line of dialogue and/or manipulates [character sprites](../graphics/sprites). Can optionally play a [voiced line](../sound/voice).

A couple of notes on sprites:
* Sprites are associated with a speaker
* Sprites will not be displayed unless the first sprite is given an entrance transition
* After the first sprite is displayed for a speaker, other sprites of that speaker can be switched to without
  entrance transitions
* Sprites will not exit unless the sprite is specified with an exit transition

For dialogue, there are a number of operators available that have different effects:
| Operator | Example | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|

| `#Wnum` | `#W20` | Waits for a number of frames before continuing to show text on the screen |
| `#Pnum` | `#P5` | Changes the color of the text; the available colors can be seen in the table below |
| `#DP` | `#DP` | "Dialogue placeholder," doesn't have much of a function |
| `#SEnum` | `#SE001` | Plays a sound effect as [`SND_PLAY`](#snd_play) |
| `#SK0` | `#SK0Shake#sk` | Shakes the text; terminated with `#sk` |

The colors available with the `#P` operator:

## `SCENE_GOTO`
**Parameters**:
* `Scene`: Name of the script file to go to

## `SCENE_GOTO2`
**Parameters**:
* `Scene`: Name of the script file to go to

Behaves as [`SCENE_GOTO`](#scene_goto), except this command does not clear a flag before jumping. Otherwise, they seem to be identical.

## `SCREEN_FADEOUT`
**Parameters**:
* `Fade Time (Frames)`: The length of the fade in frames
* `Fade out Percentage`:The percentage darkness to fade into (where 0 is fully bright and 100 is fully dark; e.g. 50 means that the screen will be 50%

* `Custom Color`: The color the fade will be if `Color` is set to `CUSTOM`
* `Location`: The screen(s) the fade will be applied to

`SELECT` cannot be used in the initial, unnamed script block.


## `SET_PLACE`
