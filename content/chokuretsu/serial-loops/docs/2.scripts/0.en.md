Scripts make up the core functionality of Chokuretsu, and so too does the script editor make up the core functionality of Serial Loops.
Scripts control the core visual novel functionality as well as the isometric map investigation phases.

Upon opening a script, you'll be greeted by the script editor interface as can be seen below.

## The Command Tree
On the left of the script editor is the command tree. Commands in scripts are divided into **script sections**. Each section contains its own set of
commands. Commands are executed sequentially from top to bottom. The first section of every script (`SCRIPT00`) has no name and is what is triggered upon 
script load &ndash; executing the `BACK` command at the end of that section then enters the first script section following it. The script sections
are used for control flow &ndash; the `GOTO`, `VGOTO`, and `SELECT` commands all allow jumping between script sections to allow for branching storylines.

To add a command, you can use the **+** button above the command tray. To add a section, use the button with a **+** inside a folder. Commands can be removed by pressing the _Delete_ key or by pressing the garbage can. Finally, the rocket ship can be used to clear a script entirely, allowing for a fresh start.

Additionally, commands and sections can be dragged and dropped to be rearranged, and commands can be cut/copy/pasted using the standard menu options, toolbar buttons, or keybindings.

## Preview & Editing
On the right side of the editor is the preview window and command editor. Selecting a command will update the preview to show you an approximation of what that command will look like in-game; it will also update the command editor to have the command's parameters. The command's parameters can be adjusted to change what the commands do. A full detailed list of the commands, their parameters, and descriptions of what they do follows in the next document.
