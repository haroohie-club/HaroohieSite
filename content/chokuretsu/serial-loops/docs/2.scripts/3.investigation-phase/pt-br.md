The final tab is the _Map Characters_ tab. In scripts with an investigation phase, this section allows editing where characters appear on the map and which script section is activated when you talk to them. Ensure that the first chibi you add to the map is Kyon and that he does not have a script associated with him. Also note that the preview does not properly render layers, so some characters may appear to be on top of or in front of objects that
they will appear behind in-game.
