title: 'Intro to Serial Loops'
---

Serial Loops is an editor for the 2009 Nintendo DS game Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu (The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya).

Why create an editor for this game? There are two main reasons:
1. Making editors is fun
2. ROM hacking is cool

In all seriousness, ROM hacking is a hobby that should be accessible to anyone interested in it. Serial Loops opens the door
to Haruhi fans interested in telling their own stories with this game engine. Chokuretsu is such a weird and interesting game
and we've discovered so much in reverse-engineering it. It only feels right that we use that knowledge to create something to
allow others to experience the game in new ways.

Anyway, you're not here to read my poor attempts to justify my actions. Let's jump into how to use this thing!
