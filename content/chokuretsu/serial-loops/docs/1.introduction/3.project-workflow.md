title: 'Project Workflow'

Once you've created your project, you'll presented with the following screen:

On the left is the **items panel**. It contains an organized tree of all the items available for editing in the game. On the right is the
**editors panel**. This is where the editors for the various items will appear when you open them.

## Save, Build, Run
Anytime you edit an item, you can choose to save your changes by clicking _File_ &rarr; _Save_ or typing Ctrl-S (or Command-S on macOS). After you've saved your project, you can click _Build_ &rarr; _Build_ or the _Build_ button in the toolbar to build the project. You can also click _Build_ &rarr; _Build and Run_ or the _Run_ button in the toolbar to build the project and then launch the emulator you specified in preferences with the built ROM.

**It is highly recommended that you save frequently as Serial Loops is still in a beta state and may crash!**

### A Note on Saving vs "Committing"
When you save an item, a file is created on disk that represents that item. However, the item is not actually committed into the archives until you 
_build_ the project. Because saving is much faster than building, we recommend that you save frequently and build only when you want to test your project.
In case you close your project without having built all your files, Serial Loops will auto-detect the existence of saved but uncommitted files and alert
you of this on project load, at which point you can build to commit those items into the archives.

### Building from Scratch
In the _Build_ menu, there is also an option to _Build from Scratch_. This option is not usually needed and can safely be ignored unless instructed to
use it by someone attempting to help you troubleshoot. It is primarily used for recovering from corrupt archives or other errors.

## Project Settings
Clicking _File_ &rarr; _Project Settings_ will open a dialog that allows you to edit the banner image and game title of your patched ROM. This is what
will appear in the Nintendo DS menu when loading your patched ROM.
