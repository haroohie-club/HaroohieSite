To dump your ROM file, you will need a Nintendo DS or 3DS system in addition to your game. Some methods will require additional peripherals, like an SD card or mobile device capable of making an unsecured hotspot.

### Dumping with a Nintendo DS or DS lite
There are two ways of dumping the game using a Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS lite system. Both require the use of a Slot-1 (DS cartridge slot) flash cart.

The first method uses a Wi-Fi hack to dump over File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The second method uses a pair of Slot-1 and Slot-2 (GBA cartridge slot) flash carts to dump the ROM directly.

#### Dump over Wi-Fi
**Requirements:**
* Nintendo DS or DS lite console
* *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu*
* Slot-1 Flash cartridge (e.g. R4 cartridge. Also, an SD or microSD card to load stuff onto it as required)
* Smartphone, tablet or other device that can create an unsecured or WEP-secured Wi-Fi hotspot
  - Most modern computers aren't able to do this, unfortunately. The best devices for doing this are Android smartphones.
  - Apple and Windows devices (including the iPhone) are not capable of creating insecure or WEP-secured hotspots.
* A computer you can use to [download wooddumper](https://digiex.net/threads/wood-dumper-dump-nintendo-ds-roms-and-save-games-over-wi-fi-with-an-nintendo-ds.14729/) and connect to said hotspot with
* A DS game with Wi-Fi support. It doesn't matter that the service has ended. Unfortunately, *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu* does not have Wi-Fi support.

**Method:**
1. Using your smartphone, tablet or other device that can create a wireless hotspot, make an unsecured (no password) or WEP secured hotspot (must be WEP-secured; WPA and other modern encryption standards are not supported by the DS).
2. On the other computer, [download wooddumper](https://digiex.net/threads/wood-dumper-dump-nintendo-ds-roms-and-save-games-over-wi-fi-with-an-nintendo-ds.14729/). Then, connect that computer to the hotspot you just created.
3. Install the wooddumper.nds (not the Slot 2 version) homebrew app onto the right part of your flash cart via the SD card.
4. Insert the Nintendo DS game that has Nintendo Wi-Fi connection support and navigate to the menu that allows you to configure your Wi-Fi connection. Connect to the hotspot you made.
5. Exit the game and remove the cartridge. Now, insert your flash cartridge you just put wooddumper on and navigate to run it on your DS.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions and insert your *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu* cart when prompted. Proceed until you are presented with an IP address to connect to using an FTP client.
7. Using an FTP client, such as [net2ftp](https://www.net2ftp.com/), a built-in browser one or another such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), enter the IP address into the relevant field. You do not need to specify a username or password.
8. Copy the .nds ROM file and .txt file to your computer. You can proceed to [patching your ROM](/chokuretsu/guide/patching-the-rom).

#### Dump using dual-slot flash cartridges
**Requirements:**
* Nintendo DS or DS lite console
* *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu*
* Slot-1 (DS slot) Flash cartridge (e.g. R4 cartridge)
* Slot-2 (GBA slot) Flash cartridge that is compatible with your Slot-1 cart (e.g. E-Link card)
* SD or microSD cards (or correct connection cables) to load and remove stuff from your flash cartridges, if necessary
* A computer you can use to download wooddumper

**Method:**
1. [Download wooddumper](https://digiex.net/threads/wood-dumper-dump-nintendo-ds-roms-and-save-games-over-wi-fi-with-an-nintendo-ds.14729/) on your computer.
2. Install the wooddumper_slot2.nds homebrew app onto the right part of your Slot-1 flash cart via the SD card.
3. Insert your Slot-1 and Slot-2 flash carts into your DS.
4. Open wooddumper via your flash cart.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and insert your *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu* cart when prompted. Proceed until you see that the dump has completed.
6. Remove your Slot-2 cart and insert the SD card from it into your PC (or in the case of some carts, connect it directly to your PC)
7. Copy the .nds ROM file and .txt file to your computer. You can proceed to [patching your ROM](/chokuretsu/guide/patching-the-rom).

**Requirements:**
* Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL console
* *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu*
* SD card with at least 2GB capacity

### Dumping with a Nintendo 3DS

* *Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu*
* SD card with at least 2GB capacity
